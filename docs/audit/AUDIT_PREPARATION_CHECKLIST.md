# XFUEL Protocol - Security Audit Preparation Checklist

**Last Updated**: [Date]  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This checklist tracks the preparation work required before submitting the XFUEL Protocol contracts for a professional security audit.

---

## Pre-Audit Requirements

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] Audit scope document (`audit-scope.md`)
- [x] Risk assessment (`risk-assessment.md`)
- [x] Known issues tracking (`known-issues.md`)
- [x] Architecture diagram (`architecture-diagram.txt`)
- [x] Bug bounty program (`../bug-bounty.md`)
- [x] Audit preparation checklist (this document)

### ⚠️ Test Coverage (CRITICAL GAP)

**Current Status**: Only MockXFUELRouter has tests (1/6 contracts)

- [ ] **XFUELRouter.sol** - Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Constructor and initialization tests
  - [ ] swapAndStake() tests
  - [ ] collectAndDistributeFees() tests
  - [ ] swap() tests
  - [ ] Access control tests (onlyOwner)
  - [ ] Fee distribution calculations
  - [ ] Edge cases and error conditions

- [ ] **XFUELPool.sol** - Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Initialization tests
  - [ ] Swap tests (both directions)
  - [ ] Fee collection tests
  - [ ] Access control tests (onlyFactory)
  - [ ] Price calculation tests
  - [ ] Edge cases (empty pools, large swaps, etc.)

- [ ] **XFUELPoolFactory.sol** - Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Pool creation tests
  - [ ] CREATE2 determinism tests
  - [ ] Fee tier validation
  - [ ] Duplicate pool prevention
  - [ ] allPools tracking

- [ ] **TreasuryILBackstop.sol** - Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] IL calculation tests
  - [ ] Coverage provision tests
  - [ ] Threshold tests (>8%)
  - [ ] Access control tests
  - [ ] Emergency withdrawal tests
  - [ ] Edge cases

- [ ] **TipPool.sol** - Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Pool creation tests
  - [ ] Tipping tests
  - [ ] Winner selection tests
  - [ ] Distribution tests (10%/90% split)
  - [ ] Randomness tests (note: current implementation vulnerable)
  - [ ] Access control tests
  - [ ] Edge cases

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Router ↔ Pool interactions
  - [ ] Pool → Backstop IL coverage flow
  - [ ] Fee collection and distribution flow
  - [ ] End-to-end swap and stake flow

**Target Coverage**: >80% line coverage

## Critical Security Fixes (MUST FIX BEFORE AUDIT)

### 🔴 High Priority

1. **C001: Reentrancy Protection**
   - [ ] Add ReentrancyGuard to XFUELRouter.collectAndDistributeFees()
   - [ ] Add ReentrancyGuard to XFUELPool.swap()
   - [ ] Add ReentrancyGuard to TreasuryILBackstop.provideCoverage()
   - [ ] Add ReentrancyGuard to TipPool.endPool()
   - [ ] Update tests to verify reentrancy protection

2. **C002: Randomness Implementation**
   - [ ] Replace block.timestamp/difficulty with Chainlink VRF
   - [ ] OR implement commit-reveal scheme
   - [ ] Update TipPool.drawWinner()
   - [ ] Update tests

3. **C003: Slippage Protection**
   - [ ] Add amountOutMinimum parameter to XFUELPool.swap()
   - [ ] Add amountOutMinimum parameter to XFUELRouter.swapAndStake()
   - [ ] Add validation logic
   - [ ] Update tests

### 🟠 Medium Priority

4. **H001: Price Oracle Integration**
   - [ ] Replace _convertToUSDC() with Chainlink oracle
   - [ ] Add oracle staleness checks
   - [ ] Update tests

5. **H004: Input Validation**
   - [ ] Add zero address checks to constructors
   - [ ] Add pool existence validation
   - [ ] Add duration limits to TipPool.createPool()
   - [ ] Add comprehensive require statements

6. **M05: SafeERC20 Usage**
   - [ ] Replace transfer() with SafeERC20.safeTransfer()
   - [ ] Update all token transfers
   - [ ] Update tests

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 🟡 Low Priority

- [ ] Add missing events to state-changing functions
- [ ] Complete NatSpec documentation
- [ ] Standardize error messages
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to named constants
- [ ] Consider pause mechanism for emergency situations
- [ ] Make fee splits configurable (future governance)

---

## External Dependencies Review

- [ ] Document IBC bridge integration points
- [ ] Document Cosmos LST contract dependencies
- [ ] Review third-party contract security (if applicable)
- [ ] Document oracle dependencies and risks

---

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Finalize constructor parameters
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts
- [ ] Test deployment on testnet
- [ ] Verify all contract addresses and configurations
- [ ] Prepare upgrade/migration plan (if applicable)

---

## Audit Firm Selection

- [ ] Research audit firms (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Consensys Diligence, etc.)
- [ ] Request quotes
- [ ] Review audit firm credentials
- [ ] Set audit timeline
- [ ] Prepare contract handoff package

---

## Audit Package Contents

The final audit package should include:

1. ✅ All source code (contracts/)
2. ✅ Comprehensive test suite (test/)
3. ✅ Test coverage report (>80% target)
4. ✅ Documentation (docs/audit/)
5. ✅ Deployment scripts
6. ✅ Known issues and fixes log
7. ✅ Architecture and design documents
8. ⚠️ Formal verification (optional, but recommended for critical functions)

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Test Suite Development**: 2-3 weeks
- **Critical Fixes Implementation**: 1-2 weeks
- **Code Quality Improvements**: 1 week
- **Final Review & Preparation**: 1 week
- **Total Estimated Time**: 5-7 weeks before audit-ready

---

## Notes

- Focus on test coverage first - it will reveal bugs and help verify fixes
- Critical security fixes (reentrancy, randomness, slippage) are non-negotiable
- All fixes should be thoroughly tested before audit submission
- Maintain this checklist as work progresses
- Update known-issues.md as issues are resolved
